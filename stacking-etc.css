/*
Stacking Context: position: fixed creates a new stacking context automatically
within its container. But positions relative and absolute do not - UNTIL
you also specify a z-index for the element. By setting position and z-index in
.package, we create a context which .package__badge (a child of .package in the
doc flow) can't escape, even though it has the highest z-index on the page.
