## Questions

- `ngx-datatable` resists displaying overflow-ellipsis. Seems to be intended as default behavior, and also others mention the same problem...
- pages-system-email - SMTP fields are disabled by a custom directive, right? So how would one change that to hidden?
- Closing out tickets
- Should I take every ticket all the way to pull request?
- Whatever slack I need to pick up
